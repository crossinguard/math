Welcome to `math.crossinguard`, a free digital learning path meant to help students of any situation learn mathematics. The mathematical content in this learning path is aligned to the [Common Core](https://www.thecorestandards.org/Math/) high school mathematics standards. However, while those standards inform the topic order and emphasis, the knowledge, instruction, and all related materials are my own.
