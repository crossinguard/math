## What is a function?

A function is a set of instructions. Provide the function an input and the function instructions will create an output specific to the input.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Function">
    ```python
    def introduce_yourself(name):
      print("Hello, " + name + "! Nice to meet you.")

    # Example usage:
    introduce_yourself("crossinguard")
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Function Output">
    `Hello, crossinguard! nice to meet you.`

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the function `introduce_yourself(name)`, the function is named "introduce_yourself" and accepts an input representing a name. Once that function is fed a name, it follows instructions, which in this case is to print/output a welcome message personalized to that name.

  <TabItem label="HSF.IF.A.1">
    Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to another set
    (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain exactly one element
    of the range. If $f$ is a function and $x$ is an element of its domain, then
    $f(x)$ denotes the output of $f$ corresponding to the input $x$. The graph
    of $f$ is the graph of the equation $y = f(x)$.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="HSF.IF.A.2">
    Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="HSF.IF.A.3">
    Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.

    For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by

    $f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n â‰¥ 1$
