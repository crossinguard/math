## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.7

Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features of the graph, by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.\*

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.7.a

Graph linear and quadratic functions and show intercepts, maxima, and minima.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.7.b

Graph square root, cube root, and piecewise-defined functions, including step functions and absolute value functions.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.7.c

Graph polynomial functions, identifying zeros when suitable factorizations are available, and showing end behavior.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.7.d

(+) Graph rational functions, identifying zeros and asymptotes when suitable factorizations are available, and showing end behavior.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.7.e

Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts and end behavior, and trigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.

## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.8

Write a function defined by an expression in different but equivalent forms to reveal and explain different properties of the function.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.8.a

Use the process of factoring and completing the square in a quadratic function to show zeros, extreme values, and symmetry of the graph, and interpret these in terms of a context.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.8.b

Use the properties of exponents to interpret expressions for exponential functions. For example, identify percent rate of change in functions such as y = (1.02)ᵗ, y = (0.97)ᵗ, y = (1.01)12ᵗ, y = (1.2)ᵗ/10, and classify them as representing exponential growth or decay.

## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.IF.C.9

Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by verbal descriptions). For example, given a graph of one quadratic function and an algebraic expression for another, say which has the larger maximum.
