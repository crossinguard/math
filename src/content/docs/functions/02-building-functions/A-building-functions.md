## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.BF.A.1

Write a function that describes a relationship between two quantities.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.BF.A.1.a

Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.BF.A.1.b

Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations. For example, build a function that models the temperature of a cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying exponential, and relate these functions to the model.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.BF.A.1.c

(+) Compose functions. For example, if T(y) is the temperature in the atmosphere as a function of height, and h(t) is the height of a weather balloon as a function of time, then T(h(t)) is the temperature at the location of the weather balloon as a function of time.

## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.BF.A.2

Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms.
