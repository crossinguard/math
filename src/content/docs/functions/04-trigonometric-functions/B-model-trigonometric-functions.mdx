## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.TF.B.5

Choose trigonometric functions to model periodic phenomena with specified amplitude, frequency, and midline.\*

## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.TF.B.6

(+) Understand that restricting a trigonometric function to a domain on which it is always increasing or always decreasing allows its inverse to be constructed.

## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.TF.B.7

(+) Use inverse functions to solve trigonometric equations that arise in modeling contexts; evaluate the solutions using technology, and interpret them in terms of the context.\*
