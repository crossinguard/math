## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.LE.A.1

Distinguish between situations that can be modeled with linear functions and with exponential functions.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.LE.A.1.a

Prove that linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals, and that exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.LE.A.1.b

Recognize situations in which one quantity changes at a constant rate per unit interval relative to another.

### CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.LE.A.1.c

Recognize situations in which a quantity grows or decays by a constant percent rate per unit interval relative to another.

## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.LE.A.2

Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).

## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.LE.A.3

Observe using graphs and tables that a quantity increasing exponentially eventually exceeds a quantity increasing linearly, quadratically, or (more generally) as a polynomial function.

## CCSS.Math.Content.HSF.LE.A.4

For exponential models, express as a logarithm the solution to abct = d where a, c, and d are numbers and the base b is 2, 10, or e; evaluate the logarithm using technology.
